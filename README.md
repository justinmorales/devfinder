This project is designed to help me get familiar with Fullstack Java development.

With this project, I will build a web application.
The web application with have a few goals.
It will be used as a proof that I can build a web application with java scripting.
I will then use a page as a resume of sorts to show off my projects and link to other social media.
I will then branch the website into a more general purpose application where users can sign up and create a page
for themselves to show off their projects and link their git repos.

I will attempt to update and bugfix this web application a few times a week actively learning while searching
for employment.

If you would like to collaborate on this project or seeking to employ me, please contact me at
